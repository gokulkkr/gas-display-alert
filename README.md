# gas-display-alert
This project will detect the different gases and display the concentration of it on a LCD Display. If the concentration level reaches the threat level, a buzzer gets turned on to warn the people. This can be integrated with the helmets of mining people to alert them. This project uses Arduino, 16x2 LCD Display and Air Quality Gas Sensor (MQ135).
